In this paper, we present three experiments showing that idea originators experience greater relationship confict with counterparts who have committed perceived “idea theft”, i.e., proposed identical or related ideas. We test a model that identifes a mechanism— self-threat — that mediates the relationship between idea theft and relationship confict and identifes an intervention to ameliorate that self-threat via self-affirmation. Study 1 demonstrates the idea originator’s attribution of malign attributions to, and negative moral emotions toward, the counterpart. Study 2 demonstrates that idea originators ostracize both those who propose identical ideas and those who propose merely related ideas. In Study 3, evidence for self-threat as the mechanism underlying the negative relational consequences is provided via both a direct test of mediation as well as via moderation by self-affirmation. Our research contributes to the nascent idea theft literature and suggests a way to reduce its negative consequences.}

Looking at both its magnificent performance, when its self-governance was fully functional, and its brutal murder by the despotic, pseudo-aristocratic or swanky regime, allows comparing politeia’s collegial, spherical decision-making structure to the ubiquitous but highly problematic, in our neo-postmodern temporality, pyramidal hierarchy of central authority and power. Doing so unveils a business proposition toward collegial, dynamic interventions, which entail focusing on civic, ethical and moral ideals, as the means to creating in business and industry the conditions necessary for the emergence of politeia’s collegially spherical decision-making structure, an innovative act of high-technology self management.}

Growing neuroscientific research provides strong evidence for the third perspective. Yet, this work foregrounds the individual’s experience, overlooking the role and context of organizing. In this article, we developed a new perspective of emotions and organizing. Our “gestalt” framework unites innate, socially constructed, and discursive ontologies to explain how emotions exist as innate yet latent organizational potentialities, become salient through social interaction, and are embedded in organizations through discourse. Together, these aspects comprise the gestalt emotion experience—where the whole is something more than its parts. The gestalt view offers organizational actors and scholars practical wisdom for navigating and analyzing emotions in organizations. }

      During the last decade natural resource crime and criminality have received growing attention from criminological scholars. There remains, however, a spirited subterranean and unresolved debate
      regarding the most appropriate nomenclature/diction to portray this form of crime and its study. Varying views exist among criminological scholars regarding the most appropriate terminology to
      describe the study of crime in the natural resource arena which has, over the years, produced somewhat of a semantical farrago. It appears therefore that the time is ripe to interrogate this
      issue more methodically in an attempt to lobby criminological scholars and conservation protagonists alike to galvanise behind one cognate indicator that passes onomastical muster. An apposite
      truism attributed to Socrates, which can be related to the issue at hand, was in fact: "Η αρχή της σοφίας είναι ο καθορισμός των όρων", literally translated as "The beginning of wisdom is the
      definition of terms", encapsulating the intrinsic thrust of this narrative. In order to probe this linguistic issue and ruminate on its constituents, it was deemed prudent to seek guidance from
      the wisdom of certain ancient Hellenic philosophers, the prominent Spinozian, Gilles Deleuze, the Cartesian and father of modern Western philosophy, René Descartes, as well as customary English
      language conventions. In the form of a four-pronged alliance these resources were marshalled to underscore and unravel the present-day diachronic dichotomies and, to a certain extent, resolve
      the ossifying impasse. An attempt is made to dispel the factoids and ersatz definitions/terminology permeating the criminological discourse in relation to the study of natural resource crime
      and criminality, to wit, green, environmental and ecological criminology. Moreover, a case is made for the recognition and entrenchment of an unambiguous sub-field of study, namely conservation
      criminology.

  pages={87--120},
  year={1990},
  publisher={Cambridge University Press},
  abstract={The conceptual focus of our approach is to conceive of wisdom as an expert knowledge system (expertise). Specifically, we view wisdom as a highly developed body of factual and procedural knowledge and judgment dealing with what we call the “fundamental pragmatics of life.” The fundamental pragmatics of life concern important but uncertain matters of life. Specifically, they involve knowledge and judgment about the course, variations, conditions, conduct, and meaning of life. Before we describe this approach in more detail, we present some of the historical background and theoretical rationales that have stimulated us to pursue research and theory on the topic of wisdom.

Our interest in the psychological study of wisdom is motivated by three general lines of psychological inquiry. A first is our interest in the study of high levels of human performance, the kind of performance that can be labeled as exceptional and expertlike (Baltes & Kliegl, 1986; Ericsson, in press; Kliegl & Baltes, 1987; Smith & Baltes, in press; Smith, Dixon, & Baltes, 1989). The second line of inquiry is our search for positive aspects of the aging mind (Baltes & Baltes, in press; Baltes & Labouvie, 1973; Baltes & Schaie, 1976). The third line of interest is work on conceptions of intelligence that reflect a concern with the contextual and pragmatic features of everyday functioning (Cornelius & Caspi, 1987; Denney, 1984; Dixon & Baltes, 1986; Rogoff & Lave, 1984; Sternberg & Wagner, 1986). These three general lines of inquiry are described in more detail in later sections of this chapter.}

Fourth, the article discusses the measurement of tacit knowledge, in general, and of wisdom, in particular. Fifth, the article discusses how wisdom might be nurtured in schools.

	abstract = {Historic inequities exacerbated by COVID-19 and spotlighted by social justice movements like Black Lives Matter have reinforced the necessity and urgency for societies and organizations to bring healing into focus. However, few integrated models exist within management and organization scholarship to guide practice. In response, our focus aims to unpack how organizations can become healing spaces. This paper offers a holistic definition of healing as the foundation for a new conceptual model of organizations as healing spaces. Drawing upon literature from clinical psychology, social psychology, and political science, we identify four perspectives that address healing in organizational contexts: (1) restorative justice, (2) posttraumatic growth, (3) relational cultural theory, and (4) dignity. These healing modalities represent prominent views of how healing can be achieved at the individual, dyadic, organizational, and societal levels. Synthesizing and building on these perspectives, we develop a typology that illustrates three ways organizations can function as healing spaces — Emergent, Endeavoring, and Exemplifying — representing a range of opportunities for how organizations can better respond to suffering. These spaces of healing are differentiated across seven dimensions, including source of harm, recipients of healing, facilitators of healing, focus of healing, length and strength of organizational attention, process of healing, and activators or enablers of healing. This research contributes to organizational healing research and to nascent social justice discussions in the management literature by exploring a range of opportunities for how organizations can better respond to suffering and substantively contribute to remedying harm from systematic bias against marginalized groups via healing.},

  abstract = {The five pillars are:
(1) Lectio (“Reading”). This refers to a general attitude of receptivity. In fact, the
first word of the RSB is Ausculta (Listen!). It refers to a lack of preconceptions,
an open mind, a detached view on oneself and the other. Lectio also embraces a general attitude of lifelong learning, both in terms of skill acquisitions, and, more importantly, of “learning to be,” of reaching one’s fullest human potential (Reiber, 2003). (2) Ascesis (“Moderation”). Contrary to how this might initially look to a contemporary reader, Ascesis is in fact a feature which aims to moderate the strains put on the monk’s life. Ascesis refers to an attitude of avoiding any exaggeration, or the courage of temperance (Naughton and Cornwall, 2006). The rule does not aim to create an overly hard lifestyle for the monks: “We are, therefore, about to found a school of the Lord’s service, in which we hope to introduce nothing harsh or burdensome” (RSB, prologue). For example, Benedict pronounces against gluttony as he does against excessive fasting; he allows his monks to drink wine (with the interesting justification given elsewhere that if they were forced to abstain, this abstinence could easily turn into a source of misplaced pride). In the same vein, the rule warns against overburdening the weaker members of the community (RSB 68), or, on the other hand, against curtailing able individuals by not allowing those who are strong to be challenged and stretched (RSB 48, 1). Closely linked to moderation and receptivity, and in a way a result of these attitudes, is discernment. Taking decisions based on discernment requires deep, dispassionate reflection, an examination of one’s consciousness, and, importantly, a strong sense of contextuality: a decision may be good in one context, and bad in another. It is the capacity of discernment that each monk is to develop, and it is one of the key requirements, especially for the role of the Abbot and those members of the community who hold posts of responsibility. Related to this is what one of our interview partners, who was the cellarer of his community, and thus responsible for the management of its brewery operations, called “portraits of monks,” by which he meant certain archetypes that can be found in any Benedictine community. The RSB provides several chapters[2] in which the holders of different roles and functions in a monastery are indeed “portrayed,” not only in some functional detail, but also, and more importantly, with an elaboration on the mindset in which the holder of a certain position should approach his or her task. According to this cellarer, the individual monk who finds himself entrusted with a particular function, can easily use these “portraits” as behavioural guidelines. (3) Labor (“Work”). Work is a very important feature of life in a Benedictine community. The role of work is twofold. First, it is needed in order to provide sustenance to the community. Second, and more importantly, manual and physically demanding work is considered to provide a necessary balance to the spiritual and mental occupations that make up much of the monks’ day. (4) Fraternitas (“Brotherhood”). The monastic community is understood to be a family, where each member has his place and is accepted as such. The attitude of Fraternitas is characterised by mutual care on one hand, and a respect of individual differences on the other. This is important in the sense that the RSB does not seek to treat all members of the community equally. Instead, it seeks to recognise each individual member’s special abilities and needs, and to place him or her in the community accordingly. The principle is that each member is to give to the community whatever and wherever he can, and to assure him that he will receive whatever he needs. The principle of Fraternitas is therefore a highly individualistic one, where differences are respected, and accommodated whenever possible, as long as the requirement of mutual care is fulfilled. For example, the RSB clearly stipulates that positions of responsibility ought not necessarily be given according to seniority, but rather according to ability. It also advocates leniency towards weaker members of the community as much as it warns against constraining the more able members of the community.In HRM terms, Fraternitas is clearly a strategy of fitting jobs to people rather than fitting people to jobs. Yet it is not driven by considerations of economic rationality; rather it reflects pastoral care and respect for the individual. Fraternitas is closely linked to:
(5) Simplicitas (“Simplicity”). This is a proxy for simple, but straightforward communication, and an avoidance of exaggerated formality or encrypted ways of interaction.We can also observe that these conceptual pillars of the RSB appear to be connected and that they reinforce and support each other, in other words, we are dealing with an internally coherent management model. For example, simplicitas interlocks with both ascesis and lectio. Fraternitas and Labor would seem to be mutually self-supporting, too.}

This article seeks to contribute to the recovery of a more complete view of the human being in management, learning from classical humanism developed throughout Western Civilization, from the Greek and Roman Philosophers and the Judeo-Christian legacy to the Renaissance. More specifically, it discusses several relevant aspects of this Classical humanism, which can aid in re-thinking management. These include a realistic epistemology and metaphysics, and the human being as a whole. Classical humanism also entails the consideration of the human action as a unity with both internal and external dimensions, ethics understood as a guide for good life, society viewed as a community of people, and being open to beauty and transcendence.}

They face unanticipated ethical issues requiring decisions that are subtle and nuanced, and they do not always find the expected guidance in current ethics guidelines. In the present article, the authors offer practical wisdom as an alternative to the deontological approach. First, we develop this complex concept and illustrate its contribution to addressing and resolving ethical issues. Second, we present a study and the model that emerged from it to illustrate how practical wisdom contributes to finding solutions to ethical dilemmas and taking the necessary action. }
